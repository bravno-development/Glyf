# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP

- **Multiple scripts** — Support a couple of scripts (e.g. hiragana, katakana).
- **Learn loop** — First version: preview → study → SRS review.
- **Sync across devices** — Account-based sync so progress follows the user.
- **Onboarding** — Script choice, daily goal, and getting started.
- **Basic dashboard** — Highlights SM-2 SRS (e.g. learnt count, accuracy, due today).
- **Settings** — GDPR-compliant “forget me” / delete-all-my-data.

## Phase 2: Post-Launch

- **Study reminders** — Notifications when it’s time to study (e.g. push or in-app).
