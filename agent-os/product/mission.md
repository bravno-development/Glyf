# Product Mission

## Problem

Learners need a way to master writing systems (e.g. Japanese hiragana/katakana) that works anywhere — not just recognition and muscle memory, but real learning — without depending on a reliable connection. Many tools are online-only or cluttered.

## Target Users

Language learners who want to master writing systems, not just recognise characters. Primary audience: self-directed learners. Students, language nerds, and self-studiers are all in scope.

## Solution

Glyf is a multi-script learning platform with spaced repetition (SM-2). It is **offline-first**: all learning data lives in the browser (IndexedDB), so it works anywhere. The backend is minimal: user accounts and cross-device sync only. The product is **free**, runs in the **browser or as a PWA on phone**, uses **SM-2 SRS across scripts** so behaviour is consistent when learning more than one script, and stays **simple** — no ads or fuss.
